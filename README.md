# Schematics CLI diff

This repository exposes a schematic generated with `schematics schematic --name sample` with each version of Schematic CLI.

A dedicated branch per version makes changes very easy
to watch. For example:

* https://github.com/slupekdev/schematics-cli-diff/compare/0.0.1...0.0.2
* https://github.com/slupekdev/schematics-cli-diff/compare/0.1002.0...0.1100.1

See table below for the complete list.

Note that this is inspired by [Angular CLI diff](https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-diff).

## Why this repository

After an upgrade of Schematic CLI on your project, you'll have to keep the configuration or dependencies up-to-date, and it can be hard to keep track.

This project lets you easily know what changed. For example, from
[0.1002.0 to the 0.1100.1](https://github.com/slupekdev/schematics-cli-diff/compare/0.1002.0...0.1100.1).
